# Original Repo

This is the original repo used to generate the Portland report. In addition, this  
Google colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14eaPzypdin96Mf0AQ_ExBuSfDwWiSAn9?usp=sharing) was used.

We have since restructured and reformatted the repo to use VoteKit, which is what appears in the "Restructured Repo" folder.
