# Sandbox

Here is a sandbox where code that did not make it into the final report lives.

- "Overvote Analysis" was an attempt to understand if there was any structure in the overvotes. We were not able to gleam much.
- "Single_member_districts" creates the counterfactual of "If there had been 12 SMDs for the election, how would people of color preferred represenatatives have faired?"
